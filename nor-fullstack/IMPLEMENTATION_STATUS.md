## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES (Production Fixes Needed)

### 1. **Next.js 15 Compatibility**
- **Issue**: API route parameters are async in Next.js 15
- **Impact**: Some dynamic routes fail to build
- **Fix Needed**: Update all `[id]` route handlers to use `await context.params`

### 2. **TypeScript Strict Mode**
- **Issue**: Some `any` types used for rapid development
- **Impact**: Build warnings (currently suppressed)
- **Fix Needed**: Replace with proper type definitions

### 3. **Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Basic error handling with alerts
- **Impact**: Poor user experience
- **Fix Needed**: Implement proper toast notifications or error boundaries
